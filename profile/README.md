# Tav in Technicolour

Thank you so much for agreeing to an interview! Would you be able to tell us a little bit about yourself? How did you get into Baldur's Gate 3, and why did you decide to start making mods for it?

Hey, thank you so much for having me - it's a very surreal experience to be asked for an interview like this! My name's Astra, and I'm really just a very regular person with a variety of interests and many, many thoughts in my head at all times.

The way I stumbled into BG3 is equally as chaotic as my brain is, really. I was made aware of the game by seeing people lose their minds about Astarion on social media, shortly after Baldur's Gate 3 was released, and was intrigued because aside from gaming, I'm also very into D&D. I'm not typically someone who reaches for new releases, as I'm incredibly picky with games, so it's very out of the ordinary for me to purchase games so close to release, let alone be absorbed by them to this degree. RPGs aren't typically something I gravitate to either, and I spent almost two weeks contemplating whether I should actually take the risk or not. Ultimately, it was very much worth it, as I've not only learned a lot but also met a lot of wonderful people, such as the folks over in the BG3 Modding Community discord server, and my wonderful partner, Kaz, who's a fellow BG3 modder.
